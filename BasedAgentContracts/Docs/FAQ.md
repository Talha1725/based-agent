# BasedAgent Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

1. **Q: What is BasedAgent?**
   A: BasedAgent is a platform that combines AI agents with tokenomics and decentralized governance. It allows developers to create, launch, and manage AI agents with their own custom tokens, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for AI development and token-based incentives.

2. **Q: How does BasedAgent differ from other AI platforms?**
   A: BasedAgent uniquely integrates blockchain technology, custom tokenomics, and decentralized governance with AI development. This combination allows for community-driven AI projects with built-in incentive structures.

3. **Q: On which blockchains does BasedAgent operate?**
   A: BasedAgent operates on both Ethereum (specifically the Base network, an Ethereum L2) and Solana blockchains.

4. **Q: Can I use BasedAgent if I'm not a developer?**
   A: Yes, while developers can create AI agents, non-developers can participate by buying tokens, referring others, or contributing to existing projects in non-technical ways.

## Token Creation and Economics

5. **Q: How are tokens created for each AI agent?**
   A: Tokens are created when an AI agent is initialized on the platform. The creator sets parameters such as name, symbol, and initial allocations.

6. **Q: What is the total supply of tokens for each AI agent?**
   A: Each AI agent has a fixed supply of 100 million tokens.

7. **Q: How are the tokens initially distributed?**
   A: The initial distribution is as follows:
   - 50-80% allocated to the bonding curve (configurable)
   - 20% reserved for DEX liquidity
   - 0-30% allocated to the Contributor Pool (configurable)

8. **Q: What is a bonding curve?**
   A: A bonding curve is a mathematical formula that determines the price of tokens based on the current supply. As more tokens are purchased, the price increases, and vice versa.

9. **Q: Can the token allocations be changed after creation?**
   A: No, the initial allocations (bonding curve, DEX liquidity, and Contributor Pool) are set at creation and cannot be changed afterwards.

## Buying and Selling Tokens

10. **Q: How can I buy tokens for an AI agent?**
    A: You can buy tokens directly from the smart contract using the bonding curve mechanism. This is typically done through a dApp interface.

11. **Q: Is there a minimum or maximum amount of tokens I can buy?**
    A: There's no set minimum or maximum, but purchases are subject to the available supply on the bonding curve and the amount of ETH/SOL you're willing to spend.

12. **Q: Can I sell my tokens back to the contract?**
    A: Yes, you can sell your tokens back to the contract at any time before the bonding curve is completed, at a price determined by the bonding curve.

13. **Q: What happens when all tokens on the bonding curve are sold?**
    A: When the bonding curve is completed, the remaining liquidity is automatically transferred to create a liquidity pool on a DEX (Uniswap V3 for Ethereum/Base, Raydium for Solana).

## Referral System

14. **Q: How does the referral system work?**
    A: Users can generate referral links. When new users buy tokens using these links, the referrer earns a portion of the fees generated by the referee.

15. **Q: What percentage of fees do referrers earn?**
    A: Referrers earn 20% of the fees generated by their referees.

16. **Q: Is there a limit to how many people I can refer?**
    A: There's no limit to the number of referrals you can make.

17. **Q: How and when are referral rewards paid out?**
    A: Referral rewards are calculated and accrued in real-time as referees make transactions. They can be claimed by the referrer at any time.

## Contributor Pool

18. **Q: What is the Contributor Pool?**
    A: The Contributor Pool is a portion of tokens reserved for rewarding contributors who help develop and improve the AI agent.

19. **Q: How are Contributor Pool tokens distributed?**
    A: Contributor Pool tokens are vested linearly over 1000 days from the time of the agent's creation.

20. **Q: Who decides how Contributor Pool tokens are allocated to specific contributors?**
    A: The allocation of Contributor Pool tokens is managed by the AI Agent's governance structure, initially the creator and later potentially a DAO.

## Governance

21. **Q: How is an AI agent governed initially?**
    A: Initially, the AI agent is governed by the creator through a 1-of-1 multisig wallet.

22. **Q: Can the governance structure change over time?**
    A: Yes, the governance can be transitioned to a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure.

23. **Q: How does the transition to a DAO work?**
    A: The current admin can transfer control to a DAO address using the `transferAdminToDao` function. After this, the DAO controls all admin functions.

24. **Q: Can token holders participate in governance?**
    A: Once transitioned to a DAO, token holders typically can participate in governance decisions, though the exact mechanics depend on the chosen DAO structure.

## Technical Questions

25. **Q: What programming languages are used in BasedAgent?**
    A: The Ethereum/Base contracts are written in Solidity, while the Solana program is written in Rust.

26. **Q: Are the smart contracts audited?**
    A: (This would depend on your actual audit status. If audited, provide details. If not, you might say something like: "We are in the process of arranging a thorough audit of our smart contracts.")

27. **Q: Can the smart contracts be upgraded?**
    A: Yes, the contracts are designed to be upgradeable to allow for future improvements and bug fixes.

28. **Q: How does cross-chain functionality work?**
    A: While BasedAgent operates on both Ethereum/Base and Solana, true cross-chain functionality (e.g., moving tokens between chains) is not currently implemented.

## Fees and Revenue

29. **Q: What fees are involved in using BasedAgent?**
    A: There's a 1% fee on all token purchases and sales. Of this, 0.5% goes to the AI Agent wallet and 0.5% to the platform wallet.

30. **Q: How is the platform sustained financially?**
    A: The platform is sustained through the 0.5% fee that goes to the platform wallet on each transaction.

31. **Q: Are there any gas fees?**
    A: Yes, users are responsible for paying gas fees for their transactions. These will vary depending on network conditions and whether you're using Ethereum/Base or Solana.

## Security and Risks

32. **Q: What happens if I lose access to my wallet?**
    A: As with any blockchain-based system, if you lose access to your wallet, you lose access to your tokens. Always ensure you securely store your private keys or seed phrases.

33. **Q: Are there any risks involved in participating in BasedAgent projects?**
    A: As with any investment or participation in crypto projects, there are risks involved. These can include smart contract risks, market volatility, and project-specific risks. Always do your own research before participating.

34. **Q: How does BasedAgent handle security?**
    A: BasedAgent employs best practices in smart contract development, including using well-tested libraries, implementing access controls, and (assuming you do this) undergoing security audits.

## Miscellaneous

35. **Q: Can I create multiple AI agents?**
    A: Yes, there's no limit to the number of AI agents that can be created on the platform.

36. **Q: How can I contribute to an AI agent project?**
    A: You can contribute by buying tokens, referring others, or offering your skills (technical or non-technical) to help develop and improve the AI agent.

37. **Q: Is BasedAgent open source?**
    A: (This depends on your actual policy. If open source, you might say: "Yes, all our smart contracts are open source and available on GitHub." If not, clarify your licensing model.)

38. **Q: How can I stay updated on BasedAgent developments?**
    A: You can follow our official social media channels, join our community chat, and subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates.
