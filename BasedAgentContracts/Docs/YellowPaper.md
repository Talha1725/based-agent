## 1. Introduction to BasedAgent

BasedAgent is a revolutionary platform that combines AI agents with tokenomics and decentralized governance. It allows developers to create, launch, and manage AI agents with their own custom tokens, fostering a collaborative ecosystem for AI development and token-based incentives.

Key Features:
- Custom token creation for AI agents
- Bonding curve for token distribution
- Referral system with rewards
- Decentralized governance options
- Cross-chain compatibility (Ethereum/BASE and Solana)
- Contributor pool for rewarding development efforts

## 2. System Architecture Overview

BasedAgent's architecture consists of several interconnected components:

1. Smart Contracts: Core logic for token creation, distribution, and management.
2. Bonding Curve: Mechanism for token price discovery and liquidity.
3. Referral System: Incentivizes user acquisition and engagement.
4. Governance: Allows transition from centralized to decentralized control.
5. Cross-Chain Bridge: Enables interoperability between Ethereum/BASE and Solana.
6. Frontend Application: User interface for interacting with the system.

The system is designed to be modular, upgradeable, and secure, with a focus on gas efficiency and scalability.

## 3. Smart Contracts

### 3.1 BasedAgentToken Contract

The BasedAgentToken contract is the core of each AI agent's tokenomics. It's implemented on both Ethereum/BASE and Solana.

Ethereum/BASE Implementation:

```solidity
contract BasedAgentToken is ERC20VotesUpgradeable, OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable {
    // ... (contract code)
}
```

Key Functions:
- `initialize`: Sets up the token with initial parameters.
- `buyTokens`: Allows users to purchase tokens through the bonding curve.
- `sellTokens`: Allows users to sell tokens back to the contract.
- `claimVestedContributorTokens`: Handles vesting for the contributor pool.

Solana Implementation:

```rust
#[program]
pub mod based_agent {
    // ... (program code)
}

#[account]
pub struct AIAgent {
    // ... (account structure)
}
```

Key Instructions:
- `initialize`: Creates and sets up the AI agent account.
- `buy_tokens`: Handles token purchases.
- `sell_tokens`: Processes token sales.
- `claim_vested_contributor_tokens`: Manages contributor token vesting.

Both implementations include metadata storage for the AI agent, including name, description, website, social media links, and logo.

### 3.2 BasedAgentReferral Contract

The referral contract manages the referral system, tracking referrals and distributing rewards.

Ethereum/BASE Implementation:

```solidity
contract BasedAgentReferral is OwnableUpgradeable, PausableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {
    // ... (contract code)
}
```

Key Functions:
- `createReferralLink`: Creates a new referral link for a user.
- `useReferralLink`: Records a new referral.
- `recordFeeAndReward`: Tracks fees and calculates rewards.
- `payReferralReward`: Distributes rewards to referrers.

Solana Implementation:

```rust
#[program]
pub mod based_agent_referral {
    // ... (program code)
}

#[account]
pub struct ReferralState {
    // ... (account structure)
}
```

Key Instructions:
- `create_referral_link`: Initializes a new referral link.
- `use_referral_link`: Records a referral.
- `record_fee_and_pay_reward`: Tracks fees and distributes rewards.

### 3.3 AIAgentFactory Contract

The factory contract is responsible for creating new AI agent tokens.

Ethereum/BASE Implementation:

```solidity
contract AIAgentFactory is OwnableUpgradeable, UUPSUpgradeable {
    // ... (contract code)
}
```

Key Functions:
- `createAIAgent`: Deploys a new BasedAgentToken contract.

Solana Implementation:

```rust
#[program]
pub mod ai_agent_factory {
    // ... (program code)
}
```

Key Instructions:
- `create_ai_agent`: Creates a new AI agent account and initializes its token.

## 4. Token Economics

Each AI agent token has the following characteristics:

- Total Supply: 100,000,000 tokens
- Distribution:
  - 50-80%: Bonding Curve (configurable)
  - 20%: Reserved for DEX liquidity
  - 0-30%: Contributor Pool (configurable)

The exact distribution between the Bonding Curve and Contributor Pool is set at token creation and cannot be changed afterward.

## 5. Bonding Curve Mechanism

The bonding curve uses a variation of the Bancor formula:

```
P(t) = v_sol / (v_token - t)
```

Where:
- P(t) is the price of the token
- v_sol is the virtual SOL/ETH reserve
- v_token is the virtual token reserve
- t is the number of tokens sold

Key aspects:
- Continuous price adjustment based on supply and demand
- Automatic market-making
- Liquidity provision

When the bonding curve reaches 100% completion:
1. The remaining liquidity is transferred to create a Uniswap V3 (Ethereum/BASE) or Raydium (Solana) liquidity pool.
2. 20% of the total token supply is added to this liquidity pool.

## 6. Referral System

The referral system incentivizes user acquisition:

- Users can generate unique referral links.
- Referrers earn 20% of the fees generated by their referees.
- Rewards are batched for gas-efficient distribution on Ethereum/BASE.
- Referral relationships and rewards are tracked on-chain.

## 7. Governance and Multisig

Initially, each AI agent is controlled by a 1/1 multisig wallet. The system supports transitioning to decentralized governance:

- Ethereum/BASE: Compatible with Aragon DAOs
- Solana: Compatible with Realms governance

The transition process involves transferring control of key functions to the DAO contract.

## 8. Cross-Chain Compatibility

BasedAgent supports both Ethereum/BASE and Solana:

- Ethereum/BASE: EVM-compatible, using Solidity smart contracts
- Solana: Uses Rust-based programs with the Anchor framework

A cross-chain bridge (to be implemented) will allow token transfers between chains.

## 9. Upgrade Mechanisms

Both implementations support upgradability:

- Ethereum/BASE: Uses the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) pattern
- Solana: Utilizes Anchor's upgrade mechanism

This allows for future improvements and bug fixes without migrating tokens or user balances.

## 10. Security Considerations

Key security features:
- Access control: Functions restricted to owner/authority
- Pausability: Critical functions can be paused in emergencies
- Arithmetic safety: SafeMath (Ethereum) and checked math (Solana) to prevent overflows
- Reentrancy protection: Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

Regular audits and formal verification are recommended before mainnet deployment.

## 11. Integration Guidelines

To integrate with BasedAgent:

1. Deploy the factory contract.
2. Use the factory to create new AI agent tokens.
3. Interact with individual token contracts for buying, selling, and managing tokens.
4. Implement the referral system in your frontend.
5. Provide interfaces for metadata management and governance transitions.

## 12. Testing and Deployment

Testing:
- Unit tests for all contract functions
- Integration tests for complex interactions
- Testnet deployment and user acceptance testing

Deployment:
- Use hardhat (Ethereum/BASE) or Anchor (Solana) for deployment
- Set up multisig wallets for initial control
- Configure initial parameters (bonding curve percentages, contributor pool allocation)
- Verify contracts on block explorers

Post-deployment:
- Monitor contract interactions
- Implement a upgrade proposal and voting system
- Regularly update frontend to support new features
