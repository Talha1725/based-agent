Detailed breakdown of each feature, including various use cases and how they're implemented in the codebase.

1. Custom Token Creation

Product Manager's Perspective: 
"Users should be able to create their own AI agent with a custom token, allowing for unique branding and tokenomics for each AI project."

User Stories:
a) "As an AI developer, I want to create a custom token for my AI agent with a specific name and symbol."
b) "As a project owner, I want to set custom allocation percentages for the bonding curve and contributor pool."
c) "As a community leader, I want to create a token with metadata that reflects our project's identity."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (AIAgentFactory.sol):
  ```solidity
  function createAIAgent(
    string memory name,
    string memory symbol,
    address aiAgentWallet,
    address contributorPoolWallet,
    uint8 bondingCurvePercentage,
    uint8 contributorPoolPercentage,
    BasedAgentToken.AgentMetadata memory agentMetadata
  ) external returns (address) {
    // Implementation details
  }
  ```
- Solana (lib.rs):
  ```rust
  pub fn initialize(
    ctx: Context<Initialize>,
    name: String,
    symbol: String,
    bonding_curve_percentage: u8,
    contributor_pool_percentage: u8,
    agent_metadata: AgentMetadata,
  ) -> Result<()> {
    // Implementation details
  }
  ```

These functions allow for flexible token creation with custom parameters and metadata.

2. Bonding Curve Mechanism

Product Manager's Perspective:
"The token should use a bonding curve mechanism for price discovery and liquidity, ensuring a fair and transparent token distribution process."

User Stories:
a) "As an early adopter, I want to buy tokens at a lower price before the project gains popularity."
b) "As a token holder, I want to be able to sell my tokens back to the contract at any time."
c) "As a project owner, I want the token price to increase as more tokens are sold, rewarding early supporters."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (BasedAgentToken.sol):
  ```solidity
  function buyTokens() external payable whenNotPaused {
    // Bonding curve buy logic
  }

  function sellTokens(uint256 tokenAmount) external whenNotPaused {
    // Bonding curve sell logic
  }

  function calculateTokensToReceive(uint256 ethAmount) public view returns (uint256) {
    // Token calculation based on bonding curve
  }
  ```
- Solana (lib.rs):
  ```rust
  pub fn buy_tokens(ctx: Context<BuyTokens>, sol_amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Bonding curve buy logic
  }

  pub fn sell_tokens(ctx: Context<SellTokens>, token_amount: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Bonding curve sell logic
  }

  fn calculate_tokens_to_receive(sol_amount: u64, v_sol: u64, v_token: u64) -> u64 {
    // Token calculation based on bonding curve
  }
  ```

These functions implement the bonding curve mechanism, allowing for dynamic pricing based on token supply.

3. Automatic Liquidity Provision to DEX

Product Manager's Perspective:
"When the bonding curve reaches completion, liquidity should automatically be transferred to a decentralized exchange to ensure continued tradability of the token."

User Stories:
a) "As a token holder, I want to be able to trade my tokens on a DEX after the initial distribution phase."
b) "As a project owner, I want the transition from bonding curve to DEX trading to be seamless and automatic."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (BasedAgentToken.sol):
  ```solidity
  function createLiquidityPool() internal {
    require(curveCompleted, "Bonding curve not completed");
    uint256 ethForLiquidity = ethRaised - 6 ether; // 85 ETH - 6 ETH (adjusted for ETH/SOL ratio)
    uint256 tokensForLiquidity = tokensForLiquidity;

    // Create Uniswap V3 pool and add liquidity
    // Implementation details for Uniswap V3 interaction
  }
  ```
- Solana (lib.rs):
  ```rust
  fn create_liquidity_pool(ctx: Context<CreateLiquidityPool>) -> Result<()> {
    let ai_agent = &mut ctx.accounts.ai_agent;
    require!(ai_agent.curve_completed, ErrorCode::CurveNotCompleted);

    let sol_for_liquidity = ai_agent.sol_raised - 6 * 10u64.pow(9); // 85 SOL - 6 SOL
    let tokens_for_liquidity = ai_agent.tokens_for_liquidity;

    // Create Raydium pool and add liquidity
    // Implementation details for Raydium interaction
  }
  ```

These functions are called automatically when the bonding curve completes, transferring liquidity to the respective DEX.

4. Referral System

Product Manager's Perspective:
"Users should be able to refer others and earn rewards, incentivizing community growth and token adoption."

User Stories:
a) "As a community member, I want to generate a referral link to share with my network."
b) "As a referee, I want to use a referral link when purchasing tokens to support the referrer."
c) "As a referrer, I want to earn a percentage of the fees generated by my referees."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (BasedAgentReferral.sol):
  ```solidity
  function createReferralLink(address referrer) external onlyOwner {
    // Create referral link logic
  }

  function useReferralLink(address referee, address referrer) external onlyOwner {
    // Use referral link logic
  }

  function recordFeeAndReward(address user, uint256 fee) external onlyOwner {
    // Record fee and calculate reward logic
  }
  ```
- Solana (referral.rs):
  ```rust
  pub fn create_referral_link(ctx: Context<CreateReferralLink>, referrer: Pubkey) -> Result<()> {
    // Create referral link logic
  }

  pub fn use_referral_link(ctx: Context<UseReferralLink>, referee: Pubkey, referrer: Pubkey) -> Result<()> {
    // Use referral link logic
  }

  pub fn record_fee_and_pay_reward(ctx: Context<RecordFee>, user: Pubkey, fee: u64) -> Result<()> {
    // Record fee and calculate reward logic
  }
  ```

These functions manage the referral system, tracking referrals and distributing rewards.

5. Contributor Pool

Product Manager's Perspective:
"A portion of the tokens should be reserved for contributors to the AI agent, incentivizing ongoing development and improvement."

User Stories:
a) "As a contributor, I want to earn tokens for my work on the AI agent."
b) "As a project owner, I want to allocate a percentage of tokens to a contributor pool."
c) "As a contributor, I want my earned tokens to vest over time to align long-term incentives."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (BasedAgentToken.sol):
  ```solidity
  function claimVestedContributorTokens() external {
    // Vesting and claim logic for contributor tokens
  }
  ```
- Solana (lib.rs):
  ```rust
  pub fn claim_vested_contributor_tokens(ctx: Context<ClaimVestedContributorTokens>) -> Result<()> {
    // Vesting and claim logic for contributor tokens
  }
  ```

These functions manage the vesting and distribution of tokens from the contributor pool.

6. Governance Transition

Product Manager's Perspective:
"The AI agent should be able to transition from centralized to decentralized governance, allowing for community-driven decision making."

User Stories:
a) "As a project owner, I want to transfer control of the AI agent to a DAO."
b) "As a token holder, I want to participate in governance decisions after the transition to a DAO."
c) "As a community member, I want the governance transition to be transparent and verifiable."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (BasedAgentToken.sol):
  ```solidity
  function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual override onlyOwner {
    // Transfer ownership logic
  }
  ```
- Solana (lib.rs):
  ```rust
  pub fn transfer_admin_to_dao(ctx: Context<TransferAdminToDAO>, new_admin: Pubkey) -> Result<()> {
    // Transfer admin rights logic
  }
  ```

These functions allow for the transfer of control to a DAO address, enabling the transition to decentralized governance.

7. Metadata Storage

Product Manager's Perspective:
"Each AI agent should have associated metadata stored on-chain, providing transparent and immutable project information."

User Stories:
a) "As a project owner, I want to set and update metadata for my AI agent."
b) "As a user, I want to view comprehensive metadata about an AI agent before interacting with it."
c) "As a developer, I want to access AI agent metadata programmatically for integration purposes."

Implementation:
- Ethereum (BasedAgentToken.sol):
  ```solidity
  struct AgentMetadata {
    string name;
    string description;
    string website;
    string telegram;
    string twitter;
    string github;
    string logoIpfsHash;
  }

  function updateAgentMetadata(AgentMetadata memory _agentMetadata) external onlyOwner {
    // Update metadata logic
  }
  ```
- Solana (lib.rs):
  ```rust
  pub struct AgentMetadata {
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub website: String,
    pub telegram: String,
    pub twitter: String,
    pub github: String,
    pub logo_ipfs_hash: String,
  }

  pub fn update_agent_metadata(ctx: Context<UpdateMetadata>, new_metadata: AgentMetadata) -> Result<()> {
    // Update metadata logic
  }
  ```

These structures and functions allow for storing and updating comprehensive agent metadata on-chain.

Each of these features is implemented in both the Ethereum and Solana codebases, providing a robust system for creating and managing AI agents with custom tokens, bonding curves, referral systems, and governance mechanisms. The automatic liquidity provision to DEX ensures a seamless transition from the initial distribution phase to open market trading.
