# Specification Guide: Akash Integration with Flexible Pricing for AI Agent Services

## Overview
This document outlines how to integrate **Akash decentralized compute** into the platform while enabling **flexible pricing** for AI Agent services. The goal is to allow Agent Developers to set custom pricing for the tasks their Agents perform, ensuring that resource usage on Akash is handled automatically and priced dynamically.

## 1. Core Components of the Integration

### 1.1. Compute Resource Allocation via Akash
- The platform will use Akash to allocate compute resources for AI Agents. The integration must:
  - **Deploy AI Agents** to Akash using pre-configured deployment templates (such as a Replit template).
  - **Monitor compute usage** in real-time, pulling resource data like CPU, memory, and storage consumption.
  - **Handle bidding** for compute power on Akash, where providers compete to offer the best price based on the Agent's resource requirements.

### 1.2. Payment System
- Payments for computational resources will be done using **USDC**, which should:
  - Allow **users to pay in USDC** for interacting with the AI Agents.
  - Enable automatic conversion of other tokens (e.g., ETH) into **USDC** to handle payments.
  - Manage payments between **end users** and the platform, **deducting fees** to be split between the platform, Agent Developer, and potentially referrers.

## 2. Flexible Pricing Model for AI Agents

### 2.1. Agent Developer-Defined Pricing
- The system must allow **Agent Developers** to set their own pricing for services. Pricing models should support:
  - **Per-task pricing**: Developers can set a fixed price for each task performed by the agent.
  - **Hourly or Usage-based Pricing**: Developers can charge based on the computational resources consumed (e.g., per CPU hour or memory usage).
  - **Subscription models**: For Agents providing recurring services, Developers should be able to set up a subscription plan where users pay a fixed amount periodically (e.g., weekly, monthly).

### 2.2. Resource Metering and Billing
- The platform should integrate Akash's **resource metering API** to track compute consumption:
  - For **dynamic pricing**, monitor resource usage such as CPU time, memory, storage, and bandwidth used by the Agent.
  - The **cost per unit of compute** should be dynamically calculated based on the Akash marketplace bidding results.

### 2.3. Task/Service Payments
- Implement the ability for **end users to pay** for AI Agent tasks in **USDC**:
  - Users will see the task's price in USDC before proceeding.
  - If users only hold ETH or other tokens, the system should convert their tokens into USDC using a **DEX integration** (like Uniswap or Coinbase Wallet conversion).
  - Once the task is completed, USDC payments will be automatically distributed.

### 2.4. Escrow for Complex Tasks
- For **long-running tasks** or **complex services**, include an **optional escrow** system:
  - Payments are held in escrow while the task is being performed.
  - Once the task is marked as complete, the funds are released to the Agent Developer.
  - If the task fails, a **refund mechanism** should trigger, sending the funds back to the user.

## 3. Akash Deployment Integration

### 3.1. Akash Deployment Templates
- Each AI Agent should be deployed on Akash via a **pre-configured template** (such as Replit), where:
  - The template defines the **resource requirements** (CPU, memory, storage) of the AI Agent.
  - **Akash’s Stack Definition Language (SDL)** will be used to declare the deployment specifications.
  - The platform will automate the deployment process through Akash’s API or CLI.

### 3.2. Automated Bidding for Resources
- The integration must automate the **bidding process** for compute power on Akash:
  - When an AI Agent is deployed, it broadcasts a request for resources to Akash providers.
  - Providers bid to offer their compute power, and the platform automatically selects the **lowest-cost bid** that meets the Agent’s resource needs.
  - The system should regularly monitor bids to ensure the Agent is getting optimal pricing for compute resources.

### 3.3. Compute Monitoring
- Implement **resource monitoring** to track the actual compute usage of the AI Agents:
  - Use Akash’s monitoring tools to collect data on resource consumption.
  - The platform should bill users based on the **real-time usage** of compute power, if applicable.

## 4. Smart Contract Implementation for Payments

### 4.1. Service Payments in USDC
- All service-related payments between **end users** and the AI Agents should be in **USDC**:
  - Develop a **smart contract** that handles the payment process, including splitting fees between the platform, Agent Developer, and referrer.
  - Include a **conversion mechanism** to accept ETH or other tokens, converting them into USDC for the service payments.

### 4.2. Fee Distribution
- The smart contract should automatically distribute the collected fees:
  - A portion goes to the **Agent Developer**.
  - A portion goes to the **platform**.
  - If applicable, a portion goes to the **referrer** who brought the user to the platform.

### 4.3. Optional Escrow Functionality
- For more complex or longer tasks, the system should allow for funds to be held in **escrow**:
  - Funds are locked until the task is confirmed as complete.
  - A **dispute resolution system** allows users to raise issues if the service is not completed as expected, triggering refunds if necessary.

## 5. Security and Permissionless Structure

### 5.1. Self-Custody and Non-Custodial Payments
- Users should always retain **self-custody** of their funds. The platform will:
  - Use a **non-custodial wallet system**, like Coinbase MPC Wallet, to facilitate payments without holding user funds.
  - The smart contract will interact directly with user wallets for payments and escrow management.

## 6. Next Steps for Developers

1. **Set up Akash integration** to handle automated bidding and real-time resource metering.
2. Build the **smart contract** for handling USDC payments, fee distribution, and optional escrow.
3. Develop the **pricing system** that allows AI Agent Developers to set flexible pricing models.
4. Implement **DEX integration** for seamless conversion from ETH to USDC.
5. Test the **end-to-end payment flow** between users, developers, and the platform.
